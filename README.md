## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a data scientist with a strong focus on building predictive models that solve real-world problems and drive data-informed decision-making. My primary tools of choice include powerful machine learning frameworks like XGBoost and LightGBM, which I use to create high-performance models for classification, regression, and ranking tasks.

My work involves the full end-to-end process of data scienceâ€”from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment. I enjoy diving deep into data, uncovering hidden patterns, and optimizing models to extract meaningful insights and achieve maximum predictive accuracy.

This repository serves as a collection of my projects, experiments, and reusable code templates. You'll find example notebooks, utility scripts, and end-to-end workflows that demonstrate best practices in machine learning, including data preprocessing techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretation using tools like SHAP and LIME.

I place a strong emphasis on model explainability and performance, ensuring that the solutions I develop are not only accurate but also interpretable and actionable. Whether itâ€™s working with tabular data, time series, or structured datasets, I aim to create models that are both technically sound and practically useful.

Iâ€™m passionate about continuously learning and sharing knowledge with the data science community. If you're interested in topics like feature importance analysis, ensemble learning, or model deployment pipelines, I hope you'll find something valuable in this repository.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore the code, fork a project, or reach out with feedback or collaboration ideas. Letâ€™s continue pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible with machine learningâ€”one model at a time.
